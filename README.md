__Notes on ESP32 bitrate__   
In ESP-IDF V4, CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN >= 2 means "halve communication speed".   
This is to support slower bitrates below 25Kbps.   
This fuature can be controlled by CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN.   
This fuature is enabled when CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN >= 2.   
See [here](https://www.esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=15581) for detail.   
This specification is not available in ESP-IDF V5.

# Troubleshooting   
There is a module of SN65HVD230 like this.   
![SN65HVD230-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/80897499-4d204e00-8d34-11ea-80c9-3dc41b1addab.JPG)

There is a __120 ohms__ terminating resistor on the left side.   
![SN65HVD230-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/89281044-74185400-d684-11ea-9f55-830e0e9e6424.JPG)

A transmission fail will occur.   
![SendFail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/80897131-98d0f880-8d30-11ea-96b6-05e50ac740a3.jpg)

I have removed the terminating resistor.   
And I used a external resistance of __150 ohms__.   
A transmission fail is fixed.   
![SN65HVD230-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/89280710-f7857580-d683-11ea-9b36-12e36910e7d9.JPG)

If the transmission fails, these are the possible causes.   
- There is no receiving app on CanBus.
- The speed does not match the receiver.
- There is no terminating resistor on the CanBus.
- There are three terminating resistors on the CanBus.
- The resistance value of the terminating resistor is incorrect.
- 3.3V transceiver and 5V transceiver are mixed.   
 Use +1V Ground Shift using Split Termination.   
 Check out Figure 7 [here](http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slla337/slla337.pdf).   
- Stub length in CAN bus is too long.   
 ISO11898 Standard specifies a maximum bus length of 40m and maximum stub length of 0.3m at 1Mbps.
 See [here](https://e2e.ti.com/support/interface-group/interface/f/interface-forum/378932/iso1050-can-bus-stub-length).   
- Noise effects.   
 It occurs when the wire cable is thin or wire cable is crossing.   
 It is preferable to use wires that are noise-proof.   

I changed the single wire to twisted wire. It's fixed.

# Using PlatformIO   
Arduino-IDE only supports ST-LINK V2.1 adapters, but OpenOCD used by PlatformIO supports both V2.0 and V2.1.   
With ST-LINK, there is no need to change boot mode when writing firmware.   
PlatformIO allows you to use cheap Chinese ST-LINK adapters like this one.   
You can get it at a low price (about $2).   
![ST-LINK-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/221345715-b86e0a93-bdf4-46dd-a9b9-c05a27b042a4.JPG)
![ST-LINK-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/221345711-7749b557-d55f-442f-8390-3632c63d5239.JPG)

Connect the ST-LINK adapter and the STM32 development board as follows.
|ST-LINK|STM32|
|:---|:---|
|3.3V|3.3V|
|GND|GND|
|SWDIO|SWIO(=PA13)|
|SWCLK|SWCLK(=PA14)|

# Advanced use of BxCan   
Skip if you don't need advanced usage.   
Advanced usage has different purposes depending on the requirements of the application.   
So I can't give you a concrete code example.   

### About transmission
STM32 has three transmit(TX) mailboxes.   
Three TX mailboxes are provided to the software for setting up messages.   
This sample code uses only the first TX mailbox and blocks the application until the send is successfully completed.   
There are two ways to know if the send was successful without blocking.   
Read the reference manual carefully and modify the source code as needed.   

- Uses a transmission completion interrupt   
 You need to set the CAN interrupt enable register (CAN_IER) appropriately.   

- Check TX mailbox space before sending   
 An application can store transmission requests in three TX mailboxes simultaneously.   
 When there are requests for multiple TX mailboxes, the transmission scheduler decides which mailbox has to be transmitted first.   
 You can specify which mailbox has priority using the CAN Master Control Register (CAN_MCR).   
 You can tell if a mailbox is free using the CAN Transmit Status Register (CAN_TSR).   
 When all three TX mailboxes are pending, no new messages can be sent until the transmit is canceled or completed.   
 When all three TX mailboxes are pending, you can choose to cancel the pending transmission, wait until the transmission is complete, or give up on the new transmission.   
 This choice depends on your application requirements.   
 When all three TX mailboxes are pending for a long time, it could be a transmission error.   
 CAN Error Status Register (CAN_ESR) should be checked.   

### About reception
STM32 has two receive(RX) mailboxes.   
Each RX Mailbox allows access to a 3-level depth FIFO, the access being offered only to the oldest received message in the FIFO.   
This sample code uses only the first RX mailbox.   
The RX mailbox is closely related to the receive filter settings.   
By properly setting the receive filter, you can sort the received messages into two RX Mailboxes.   
For example, high priority messages can be stored in the first RX MailBox and low priority messages can be stored in the second RX MailBox.   
Read the reference manual carefully and modify the source code as needed.
